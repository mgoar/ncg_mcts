# Network Creation Games: Nash Equilibrium graphs for High-Price Links. A learning approach using Monte Carlo Tree Search
Code associated to my Master thesis (January 2024). 

In this thesis, we investigate the applicability of a modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework, specifically [Monte Carlo Tree Search](http://www.incompleteideas.net/609%20dropbox/other%20readings%20and%20resources/MCTS-survey.pdf), in addressing an algorithmic game theory setting, namely [Network Creation Games](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/872035.872088).
